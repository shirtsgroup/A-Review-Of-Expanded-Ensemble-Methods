abstract = {Prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), a member of the prolyl endopeptidase family, is known to play a role in several neurological disorders. Its primary function is to cleave a wide range of small oligopeptides, including neuroactive peptides. We have used force biased molecular dynamics simulation to study the binding mechanism of POP. We examined three possible binding pathways using Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) and Umbrella Sampling (US) on a crystal structure of porcine POP with bound Z-pro-prolinal (ZPP). Using SMD, an exit pathway between the first and seventh blade of the $\beta$-propeller domain of POP was found to be a nonviable route. US on binding pathways through the $\beta$-propeller tunnel and the TYR190-GLN208 flexible loop at the interface between both POP domains allowed us to isolate the flexible loop pathway as the most probable. Further analysis of that pathway suggests a long-range covariation of the interdomain H-bond network, which indicates the possibility of large-scale domain reorientation observed in bacterial homologues and hypothesized to also occur in human POP.},

abstract = {Free Energy Perturbation with Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics \{(FEP/REMD)\} offers a powerful strategy to improve the convergence of free energy computations. In particular, it has been shown previously that a \{FEP/REMD\} scheme allowing random moves within an extended replica ensemble of thermodynamic coupling parameters \{$\backslash$textquotedblleft\}?\{$\backslash$textquotedblright\} can improve the statistical convergence in calculations of absolute binding free energy of ligands to proteins \{[J.\} Chem. Theory Comput. 2009, 5, 2583]. In the present study, \{FEP/REMD\} is extended and combined with an accelerated \{MD\} simulations method based on Hamiltonian replica-exchange \{MD\} \{(H-REMD)\} to overcome the additional problems arising from the existence of kinetically trapped conformations within the protein receptor. In the combined strategy, each system with a given thermodynamic coupling factor ? in the extended ensemble is further coupled with a set of replicas evolving on a biased energy surface with boosting potentials used to accelerate the interconversion among different rotameric states of the side chains in the neighborhood of the binding site. Exchanges are allowed to occur alternatively along the axes corresponding to the thermodynamic coupling parameter ? and the boosting potential, in an extended dual array of coupled ?- and \{H-REMD\} simulations. The method is implemented on the basis of new extensions to the \{REPDSTR\} module of the biomolecular simulation program \{CHARMM.\} As an illustrative example, the absolute binding free energy of p-xylene to the nonpolar cavity of the \{L99A\} mutant of the T4 lysozyme was calculated. The tests demonstrate that the dual \{?-REMD\} and \{H-REMD\} simulation scheme greatly accelerates the configurational sampling of the rotameric states of the side chains around the binding pocket, thereby improving the convergence of the \{FEP\} computations.},

Calculations on two parallel computers with different processor and communication structures showed that a given accuracy can be attained over a range of parameter space, and that the attributes of the hardware and simulation system control which parameter sets are optimal. This information can be used to find the fastest available PME parameter sets that achieve a given accuracy.

The successive fine graining (SFG) scheme is used to extrapolate the results of bead-spring chain simulations to the limit where the number of springs (Ns) approaches the number of rods (equal to the number of Kuhn steps, Nk) in a bead-rod model. It is found that in the absence of excluded volume (EV) and hydrodynamic interactions (HI), the analytical results for linear viscoelastic properties obtained using the bead-spring model with the SFG scheme are in complete agreement with the infinitely stiff Fraenkel spring results. The numerical computations of linear viscoelastic properties in the presence of HI are found to be in good agreement with the results of the bead-rod model. In shear flow, the SFG results show excellent agreement with bead-rod results for a range of shear rates both in the absence and presence of HI and EV. In the limit Ns-->Nk, the numerical and analytical results obtained using the SFG scheme are found to be independent of the choice of spring force law.},

abstract = {I chart the considerable changes in the status and conception of the Lenz-Ising model from 1920 to 1950 in terms of three phases: In the early 1920s, Lenz and Ising introduced the model in the field of ferromagnetism. Based on an exact derivation, Ising concluded that it is incapable of displaying ferromagnetic behavior, a result he erroneously extended to three dimensions. In the next phase, Lenz and Ising’s contemporaries rejected the model as a representation of ferromagnetic materials because of its conflict with the new quantum mechanics. In the third phase, from the early 1930s to the early 1940s, the model was revived as a model of cooperative phenomena. I provide more detail on this history than the earlier accounts of Brush (1967) and Hoddeson, Schubert, Heims, and Baym (1992) and question some of their conclusions. Moreover, my account differs from these in its focus on the development of the model in its capacity as a model . It examines three aspects of this development: (1) the attitudes on the degree of physical realism of the Lenz-Ising model in its representation of physical phenomena; (2) the various reasons for studying and using it; and (3) the effect of the change in its theoretical basis during the transition from the old to the new quantum mechanics. A major theme of my study is that even though the Lenz-Ising model is not fully realistic, it is more useful than more realistic models because of its mathematical tractability. I argue that this point of view, important for the modern conception of the model, is novel and that its emergence, while perhaps not a consequence of its study, is coincident with the third phase of its development.},

The progress in the development of template-based docking and the vast experience in template-based modeling of individual proteins show that, generally, such approaches are more reliable than the free modeling. The key aspect of this modeling paradigm is the availability of the templates. The current common perception is that due to the difficulties in experimental structure determination of protein-protein complexes, the pool of docking templates is insignificant, and thus a broad application of template-based docking is possible only at some future time. The results of our large scale, systematic study show that, surprisingly, in spite of the limited number of protein-protein complexes in the Protein Data Bank, docking templates can be found for complexes representing almost all the known protein-protein interactions, provided the components themselves have a known structure or can be homology-built. About one-third of the templates are of good quality when they are compared to experimental structures in test sets extracted from the Protein Data Bank and would be useful starting points in modeling the complexes. This finding dramatically expands our ability to model protein interactions, and has far-reaching implications for the protein docking field in general.},

abstract = {Crystal structure prediction for organic molecules requires both the fast assessment of thousands to millions of crystal structures and the greatest possible accuracy in their relative energies. We describe a crystal lattice simulation program, DMACRYS, emphasizing the features that make it suitable for use in crystal structure prediction for pharmaceutical molecules using accurate anisotropic atom-atom model intermolecular potentials based on the theory of intermolecular forces. DMACRYS can optimize the lattice energy of a crystal, calculate the second derivative properties, and reduce the symmetry of the spacegroup to move away from a transition state. The calculated terahertz frequency k = 0 rigid-body lattice modes and elastic tensor can be used to estimate free energies. The program uses a distributed multipole electrostatic model (Q, t = 00,...,44s) for the electrostatic fields, and can use anisotropic atom-atom repulsion models, damped isotropic dispersion up to R(-10), as well as a range of empirically fitted isotropic exp-6 atom-atom models with different definitions of atomic types. A new feature is that an accurate model for the induction energy contribution to the lattice energy has been implemented that uses atomic anisotropic dipole polarizability models (alpha, t = (10,10)...(11c,11s)) to evaluate the changes in the molecular charge density induced by the electrostatic field within the crystal. It is demonstrated, using the four polymorphs of the pharmaceutical carbamazepine C(15)H(12)N(2)O, that whilst reproducing crystal structures is relatively easy, calculating the polymorphic energy differences to the accuracy of a few kJ mol(-1) required for applications is very demanding of assumptions made in the modelling. Thus DMACRYS enables the comparison of both known and hypothetical crystal structures as an aid to the development of pharmaceuticals and other speciality organic materials, and provides a tool to develop the modelling of the intermolecular forces involved in molecular recognition processes.},

abstract = {The widespread popularity of replica exchange and expanded ensemble algorithms for simulating complex molecular systems in chemistry and biophysics has generated much interest in discovering new ways to enhance the phase space mixing of these protocols in order to improve sampling of uncorrelated configurations. Here, we demonstrate how both of these classes of algorithms can be considered as special cases of Gibbs sampling within a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework. Gibbs sampling is a well-studied scheme in the field of statistical inference in which different random variables are alternately updated from conditional distributions. While the update of the conformational degrees of freedom by Metropolis Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics unavoidably generates correlated samples, we show how judicious updating of the thermodynamic state indices--corresponding to thermodynamic parameters such as temperature or alchemical coupling variables--can substantially increase mixing while still sampling from the desired distributions. We show how state update methods in common use can lead to suboptimal mixing, and present some simple, inexpensive alternatives that can increase mixing of the overall Markov chain, reducing simulation times necessary to obtain estimates of the desired precision. These improved schemes are demonstrated for several common applications, including an alchemical expanded ensemble simulation, parallel tempering, and multidimensional replica exchange umbrella sampling.},

abstract = {The holy grail of tumor modeling is to formulate theoretical and computational tools that can be utilized in the clinic to predict neoplastic progression and propose individualized optimal treatment strategies to control cancer growth. In order to develop such a predictive model, one must account for the numerous complex mechanisms involved in tumor growth. Here we review the research work that we have done toward the development of an 'Ising model' of cancer. The Ising model is an idealized statistical-mechanical model of ferromagnetism that is based on simple local-interaction rules, but nonetheless leads to basic insights and features of real magnets, such as phase transitions with a critical point. The review begins with a description of a minimalist four-dimensional (three dimensions in space and one in time) cellular automaton (CA) model of cancer in which cells transition between states (proliferative, hypoxic and necrotic) according to simple local rules and their present states, which can viewed as a stripped-down Ising model of cancer. This model is applied to study the growth of glioblastoma multiforme, the most malignant of brain cancers. This is followed by a discussion of the extension of the model to study the effect on the tumor dynamics and geometry of a mutated subpopulation. A discussion of how tumor growth is affected by chemotherapeutic treatment, including induced resistance, is then described. We then describe how to incorporate angiogenesis as well as the heterogeneous and confined environment in which a tumor grows in the CA model. The characterization of the level of organization of the invasive network around a solid tumor using spanning trees is subsequently discussed. Then, we describe open problems and future promising avenues for future research, including the need to develop better molecular-based models that incorporate the true heterogeneous environment over wide range of length and time scales (via imaging data), cell motility, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and cell-cell communication. A discussion about the need to bring to bear the powerful machinery of the theory of heterogeneous media to better understand the behavior of cancer in its microenvironment is presented. Finally, we propose the possibility of using optimization techniques, which have been used profitably to understand physical phenomena, in order to devise therapeutic (chemotherapy/radiation) strategies and to understand tumorigenesis itself.},

However, spin glasses differ from structural glasses in a crucial feature: they enjoy a time reversal symmetry. This symmetry can be broken by applying an external magnetic field, but embarrassingly little is known about the critical behavior of a spin glass in a field. In this context, the space dimension is crucial. Simulations are easier to interpret in a large number of dimensions, but one must work below the upper critical dimension (i.e., in d < 6) in order for results to have relevance for experiments. Here we show conclusive evidence for the presence of a phase transition in a four-dimensional spin glass in a field.

abstract = {Organic semiconductors have unique properties compared to traditional inorganic materials such as amorphous or crystalline silicon. Some important advantages include their adaptability to low-temperature processing on flexible substrates, low cost, amenability to high-speed fabrication, and tunable electronic properties. These features are essential for a variety of next-generation electronic products, including low-power flexible displays, inexpensive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, and printable sensors, among many other applications. Accordingly, the preparation of new materials based on $\pi$-conjugated organic molecules or polymers has been a central scientific and technological research focus over the past decade. Currently, p-channel (hole-transporting) materials are the leading class of organic semiconductors. In contrast, high-performance n-channel (electron-transporting) semiconductors are relatively rare, but they are of great significance for the development of plastic electronic devices such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). In this Account, we highlight the advances our team has made toward realizing moderately and highly electron-deficient n-channel oligomers and polymers based on oligothiophene, arylenediimide, and (bis)indenofluorene skeletons. We have synthesized and characterized a "library" of structurally related semiconductors, and we have investigated detailed structure-property relationships through optical, electrochemical, thermal, microstructural (both single-crystal and thin-film), and electrical measurements. Our results reveal highly informative correlations between structural parameters at various length scales and charge transport properties. We first discuss oligothiophenes functionalized with perfluoroalkyl and perfluoroarene substituents, which represent the initial examples of high-performance n-channel semiconductors developed in this project. The OFET characteristics of these compounds are presented with an emphasis on structure-property relationships. We then examine the synthesis and properties of carbonyl-functionalized oligomers, which constitute second-generation n-channel oligothiophenes, in both vacuum- and solution-processed FETs. These materials have high carrier mobilities and good air stability. In parallel, exceptionally electron-deficient cyano-functionalized arylenediimide derivatives are discussed as early examples of thermodynamically air-stable, high-performance n-channel semiconductors; they exhibit record electron mobilities of up to 0.64 cm(2)/V·s. Furthermore, we provide an overview of highly soluble ladder-type macromolecular semiconductors as OFET components, which combine ambient stability with solution processibility. A high electron mobility of 0.16 cm(2)/V·s is obtained under ambient conditions for solution-processed films. Finally, examples of polymeric n-channel semiconductors with electron mobilities as high as 0.85 cm(2)/V·s are discussed; these constitute an important advance toward fully printed polymeric electronic circuitry. Density functional theory (DFT) computations reveal important trends in molecular physicochemical and semiconducting properties, which, when combined with experimental data, shed new light on molecular charge transport characteristics. Our data provide the basis for a fundamental understanding of charge transport in high-performance n-channel organic semiconductors. Moreover, our results provide a road map for developing functional, complementary organic circuitry, which requires combining p- and n-channel transistors.},

 out, whereby the recombination rate may become considerably larger after the falling edge of an

abstract = {We obtain upper bounds on the spectral gap of Markov chains constructed by parallel and simulated tempering, and provide a set of sufficient conditions for torpid mixing of both techniques. Combined with the results of Woodard, Schmidler and Huber (2009), these results yield a two-sided bound on the spectral gap of these algorithms. We identify a persistence property of the target distribution, and show that it can lead unexpectedly to slow mixing that commonly used convergence diagnostics will fail to detect. For a multimodal distribution, the persistence is a measure of how ``spiky'', or tall and narrow, one peak is relative to the other peaks of the distribution. We show that this persistence phenomenon can be used to explain the torpid mixing of parallel and simulated tempering on the ferromagnetic mean-field Potts model shown previously. We also illustrate how it causes torpid mixing of tempering on a mixture of normal distributions with unequal covariances in \{R\{$\backslash$textasciicircum\}M,\} a previously unknown result with relevance to statistical inference problems. More generally, anytime a multimodal distribution includes both very narrow and very wide peaks of comparable probability mass, parallel and simulated tempering are shown to mix slowly.},

abstract = {We propose materials design of high-TC wide band-gap dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) based on first-principles calculations by using the Korringa–Kohn–Rostoker coherent potential approximation (KKR-CPA) method. First, we discuss a unified physical picture of ferromagnetism in II–VI and III–V DMSs and show that DMS family is categorized into two groups depending on the electronic structure. One is the system where Zener's double exchange mechanism dominates in the ferromagnetic interaction, and in the other systems Zener's p–d exchange mechanism dominates. Next, we develop an accurate method for TC calculation for the DMSs and show that the mean field approximation completely fails to predict Curie temperature of DMS in particular for wide-gap DMS where the exchange interaction is short-ranged. The calculated TC of homogeneous DMSs by using the present method agrees very well with available experimental values. For more realistic material design, we simulate spinodal nano-decomposition by applying the Monte Carlo method to the Ising model with ab initio chemical pair interactions between magnetic impurities in DMS. It is found that by controlling the dimensionality of the decomposition various characteristic phases occur in DMS such as 3D Dairiseki-phase and 1D Konbu-phase, and it is suggested that super-paramagnetic blocking phenomena should be important to understand the magnetism of wide-gap DMS. Based on the present simulations for spinodal nano-decomposition, we propose a new crystal growth method of positioning by seeding and shape controlling method in 100 Tera-bit density of nano-magnets in the semiconductor matrix with high-TC (or high-TB).},

abstract = {In the quest towards coarse-grained potentials and new water models, we present an extension of the force matching technique to parameterize an all-atom force field for rigid water. The methodology presented here allows to improve the matching procedure by first optimizing the weighting exponents present in the objective function. A new gauge for unambiguously evaluating the quality of the fit has been introduced; it is based on the root mean square difference of the distributions of target properties between reference data and fitted potentials. Four rigid water models have been parameterized; the matching procedure has been used to assess the role of the ghost atom in TIP4P-like models and of electrostatic damping. In the former case, burying the negative charge inside the molecule allows to fit better the torques. In the latter, since short-range interactions are damped, a better fit of the forces is obtained. Overall, the best performing model is the one with a ghost atom and with electrostatic damping. The approach shown in this paper is of general validity and could be applied to any matching algorithm and to any level of coarse graining, also for non-rigid molecules.},

abstract = {We examine in detail the theoretical underpinnings of previous successful applications of local
 molecular field (LMF) theory to charged systems. LMF theory generally accounts for the averaged
 effects of long-ranged components of the intermolecular interactions by using an effective or
 restructured external field. The derivation starts from the exact Yvon–Born Green hierarchy and
 shows that the approximation can be very accurate when the interactions averaged over are slowly
 varying at characteristic nearest-neighbor distances. Application of LMF theory to Coulomb
 interactions alone allows for great simplifications of the governing equations. LMF theory then
 reduces to a single equation for a restructured electrostatic potential that satisfies Poisson's
 equation defined with a smoothed charge density. Because of this charge smoothing by a Gaussian of
 width $\sigma$, this equation may be solved more simply than the detailed simulation geometry might
 suggest. Proper choice of the smoothing length $\sigma$ plays a major role in ensuring the accuracy of this
 approximation. We examine the results of a basic confinement of water between corrugated walls and
 justify the simple LMF equation used in a previous publication. We further generalize these results
 to confinements that include fixed charges in order to demonstrate the broader impact of charge
 smoothing by $\sigma$. The slowly varying part of the restructured electrostatic potential will be more
 symmetric than the local details of confinements.},

The dependence of the paraelectric and antiferroelectric states of dipolar chromophores on the chromophore concentration and the strength of the poling field is discussed. Phase transitions between the para- and antiferroelectric states are investigated within the limits of the Ising and isotropic models for the chromophore dipoles and are considered for varying chromophore concentration, poling field strength, and macroscopic shape of the sample used for poling. The macroscopic polarization and electro-optic coefficient of the material change drastically upon phase transition. The theories are compared with the experimental data on the electro-optic coefficient dependence on the chromophore concentration. The isotropic dipole model shows excellent agreement with experiment for the chromophore systems most commonly used in nonlinear optics.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of polymorphism, the ability of a molecule to adopt more than one crystal structure, is a well-established property of crystalline solids. The possible variations in physical properties between polymorphs make the reliable reproduction of a crystalline form essential for all research using organic materials, as well as quality control in manufacture. Thus, the last two decades have seen both an increase in interest in polymorphism and the availability of the computer power needed to make the computational prediction of organic crystal structures a practical possibility. In the past decade, researchers have made considerable improvements in the theoretical basis for calculating the sets of structures that are within the energy range of possible polymorphism, called crystal energy landscapes. It is common to find that a molecule has a wide variety of ways of packing with lattice energy within a few kilojoules per mole of the most stable structure. However, as we develop methods to search for and characterize "all" solid forms, it is also now usual for polymorphs and solvates to be found. Thus, the computed crystal energy landscape reflects and to an increasing extent "predicts" the emerging complexity of the solid state observed for many organic molecules. This Account will discuss the ways in which the calculation of the crystal energy landscape of a molecule can be used as a complementary technique to solid form screening for polymorphs. Current methods can predict the known crystal structure, even under "blind test" conditions, but such successes are generally restricted to those structures that are the most stable over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. The other low-energy structures can be alternative polymorphs, which have sometimes been found in later experimental studies. Examining the computed structures reveals the various compromises between close packing, hydrogen bonding, and pi-pi stacking that can result in energetically feasible structures. Indeed, we have observed that systems with many almost equi-energetic structures that contain a common interchangeable motif correlate with a tendency to disorder and problems with control of the crystallization product. Thus, contrasting the computed crystal energy landscape with the known crystal structures of a given molecule provides a valuable complement to solid form screening, and the examination of the low-energy structures often leads to a rationalization of the forms found.},

Additionally, the coercive field of symmetric hysteresis depends on the amplitude of magnetic field and the Fourier coefficients of the first harmonics of both real and imaginary parts. This suggests that the hysteresis behavior can be classified and modeled in frequency domain using the Fourier analysis.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances, precise simulation of freezing transitions continues to be a challenging task. In this work, a simulation method for fluid-solid transitions is developed. The method is based on a modification of the constrained cell model which was proposed by Hoover and Ree [J. Chem. Phys. 47, 4873 (1967)]10.1063/1.1701730. In the constrained cell model, each particle is confined in a single Wigner-Seitz cell. Hoover and Ree pointed out that the fluid and solid phases can be linked together by adding an external field of variable strength. High values of the external field favor single occupancy configurations and thus stabilize the solid phase. In the present work, the modified cell model is simulated in the constant-pressure ensemble using tempering and histogram reweighting techniques. Simulation results on a system of hard spheres indicate that as the strength of the external field is reduced, the transition from solid to fluid is continuous at low and intermediate pressures and discontinuous at high pressures. Fluid-solid coexistence for the hard-sphere model is established by analyzing the phase transition of the modified model in the limit in which the external field vanishes. The coexistence pressure and densities are in excellent agreement with current state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {The hydrophobic effect--a rationalization of the insolubility of nonpolar molecules in water--is centrally important to biomolecular recognition. Despite extensive research devoted to the hydrophobic effect, its molecular mechanisms remain controversial, and there are still no reliably predictive models for its role in protein-ligand binding. Here we describe a particularly well-defined system of protein and ligands--carbonic anhydrase and a series of structurally homologous heterocyclic aromatic sulfonamides--that we use to characterize hydrophobic interactions thermodynamically and structurally. In binding to this structurally rigid protein, a set of ligands (also defined to be structurally rigid) shows the expected gain in binding free energy as hydrophobic surface area is added. Isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrates that enthalpy determines these increases in binding affinity, and that changes in the heat capacity of binding are negative. X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations are compatible with the proposal that the differences in binding between the homologous ligands stem from changes in the number and organization of water molecules localized in the active site in the bound complexes, rather than (or perhaps in addition to) release of structured water from the apposed hydrophobic surfaces. These results support the hypothesis that structured water molecules--including both the molecules of water displaced by the ligands and those reorganized upon ligand binding--determine the thermodynamics of binding of these ligands at the active site of the protein. Hydrophobic effects in various contexts have different structural and thermodynamic origins, although all may be manifestations of the differences in characteristics of bulk water and water close to hydrophobic surfaces.},

@article{distributed_replica_sampling_2006,
abstract = {Distributed replica sampling [
T. Rodinger et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2, 725 (2006)
] is a simple and general scheme for Boltzmann sampling of conformational space by computer simulation in which multiple replicas of the system undergo a random walk in reaction coordinate or temperature space. Individual replicas are linked through a generalized Hamiltonian containing an extra potential energy term or bias which depends on the distribution of all replicas, thus enforcing the desired sampling distribution along the coordinate or parameter of interest regardless of free energy barriers. In contrast to replica exchange methods, efficient implementation of the algorithm does not require synchronicity of the individual simulations. The algorithm is inherently suited for large-scale simulations using shared or heterogeneous computing platforms such as a distributed network. In this work, we build on our original algorithm by introducing Boltzmann-weighted jumping, which allows moves of a larger magnitude and thus enhances sampling efficiency along the reaction coordinate. The approach is demonstrated using a realistic and biologically relevant application; we calculate the standard binding free energy of benzene to the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme. Distributed replica sampling is used in conjunction with thermodynamic integration to compute the potential of mean force for extracting the ligand from protein and solvent along a nonphysical spatial coordinate. Dynamic treatment of the reaction coordinate leads to faster statistical convergence of the potential of mean force than a conventional static coordinate, which suffers from slow transitions on a rugged potential energy surface.},

abstract = {Molecular mechanical force field (FF) methods are useful in studying condensed phase properties. They are complementary to experiments and can often go beyond experiments in atomic details. Even if a FF is specific for studying structures, dynamics, and functions of biomolecules, it is still important for the FF to accurately reproduce the experimental liquid properties of small molecules that represent the chemical moieties of biomolecules. Otherwise, the force field may not describe the structures and energies of macromolecules in aqueous solutions properly. In this work, we have carried out a systematic study to evaluate the General AMBER Force Field (GAFF) in studying densities and heats of vaporization for a large set of organic molecules that covers the most common chemical functional groups. The latest techniques, such as the particle mesh Ewald (PME) for calculating electrostatic energies and Langevin dynamics for scaling temperatures, have been applied in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For density, the average percent error (APE) of 71 organic compounds is 4.43\% when compared to the experimental values. More encouragingly, the APE drops to 3.43\% after the exclusion of two outliers and four other compounds for which the experimental densities have been measured with pressures higher than 1.0 atm. For the heat of vaporization, several protocols have been investigated, and the best one, P4/ntt0, achieves an average unsigned error (AUE) and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.93 and 1.20 kcal/mol, respectively. How to reduce the prediction errors through proper van der Waals (vdW) parametrization has been discussed. An encouraging finding in vdW parametrization is that both densities and heats of vaporization approach their “ideal” values in a synchronous fashion when vdW parameters are tuned. The following hydration free energy calculation using thermodynamic integration further justifies the vdW refinement. We conclude that simple vdW parametrization can significantly reduce the prediction errors. We believe that GAFF can greatly improve its performance in predicting liquid properties of organic molecules after a systematic vdW parametrization, which will be reported in a separate paper.},

The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},

In the case of TP, collected neutron diffraction structural data were included in the high resolution X-ray multipole refinement procedure. Although TP and OP form generally similar layered crystal architectures, the two structures differ significantly in details, due to slightly different conformations of the benzidinium cation, different packing, and thus intermolecular interactions. This is reflected in charge density distribution, crystal morphology and growth. For TP, the integrated charge for the chloride anions is equal to c.a. -0.9e, while for OP it is -1.07e. In consequence, charges for the benzidinium cation are equal to +1.85e for TP and +2.12e for OP. Different charge distributions for both polymorphs cause significant differences in the electrostatic potential. In the case of OP, the electrostatic potential for the ?NH3+ group is substantially higher than for TP. Lower values of charge density at aromatic rings of the benzidinium cation for TP can be associated with significant contribution of stacking type of interactions. TP is slightly (ca. 10-15 kJ?mol-1) more thermodynamically advantageous than OP, however the difference constitutes just a small percentage of the total cohesive energy derived (ca. -1500 kJ?mol-1). Therefore, both polymorphic forms can be obtained simultaneously from one solution under the same conditions. On the other hand, TP is characterised by a more homogeneous distribution of ionic fragments in its crystal lattice than OP. The straightforward comparison of the crucial interlayer interaction energies and the surface free energy values between both polymorphs shows that in the case of TP crystal faces should be more eager to grow, being slightly less stable than in OP. Lower surface free energy in OP, and especially low interlayer interaction energy of (100) slabs, presumably hampers further growth of the initially formed crystals, explaining the difficulties in obtaining OP crystals of the size suitable for neutron diffraction experiment. Naturally, kinetic effects should not be neglected. Nevertheless, the energy results show that despite the resemblance of the cohesive energy values of polymorphs, the character and features of their crystal architectures may cause significant differences in crystallisation mechanisms and crystal quality.

abstract = {In this work, we propose the evaluation of the free energy in molecular systems, in a "single" step, by "deleting" all the molecules in the system. The approach can be considered as the statistical mechanics analogous of the evaluation of the potential energy in classical mechanics by accounting for the necessary work to transfer all particles one by one to infinite distance. As a result, the free energy of an atomistic system can now be expressed, as an ensemble average over a configurational function that corresponds  to the contribution of each microstate, to the free energy of the ensemble. Moreover, the proposed method is capable of evaluating, the free energy as a function of the density, from the simulated density down to zero. Finally, the proposed method is related to the Rosenbluth sampling of the inverse process, that of inserting (instead of deleting) and provide the analogous theorems to Bennett's and Crook's work (Bennett, C. H. Journal of Computational Physics 1976, 22, 245, Crooks, G. E. Physical Review E 1999, 60, 2721.).

abstract = {The information theory measure of transfer entropy is used to extract the causality of correlated motions from molecular dynamics simulations. For each pair of correlated residues, the method quantifies which residue drives the correlated motions, and which residue responds. The measure reveals how correlated motions are used to transmit information through the system, and helps to clarify the link between correlated motions and biological function in biomolecular systems. The method is illustrated by its application to the Ets-1 transcription factor, which partially unfolds upon binding DNA. The calculations show dramatic changes in the direction of information flow upon DNA binding, and elucidate how the presence of DNA is communi- cated from the DNA binding H1 and H3 helices to inhibitory helix HI-1. Helix H4 is shown to act as a relay, which is attenuated in the apo state.},

@article{Sala2012,
abstract = {In the quest towards coarse-grained potentials and new water models, we present an extension of the force matching technique to parameterize an all-atom force field for rigid water. The methodology presented here allows to improve the matching procedure by first optimizing the weighting exponents present in the objective function. A new gauge for unambiguously evaluating the quality of the fit has been introduced; it is based on the root mean square difference of the distributions of target properties between reference data and fitted potentials. Four rigid water models have been parameterized; the matching procedure has been used to assess the role of the ghost atom in TIP4P-like models and of electrostatic damping. In the former case, burying the negative charge inside the molecule allows to fit better the torques. In the latter, since short-range interactions are damped, a better fit of the forces is obtained. Overall, the best performing model is the one with a ghost atom and with electrostatic damping. The approach shown in this paper is of general validity and could be applied to any matching algorithm and to any level of coarse graining, also for non-rigid molecules.},

	abstract = {Free Energy Perturbation with Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics {(FEP/REMD)} offers a powerful strategy to improve the convergence of free energy computations. In particular, it has been shown previously that a {FEP/REMD} scheme allowing random moves within an extended replica ensemble of thermodynamic coupling parameters {\textquotedblleft}?{\textquotedblright} can improve the statistical convergence in calculations of absolute binding free energy of ligands to proteins {[J.} Chem. Theory Comput. 2009, 5, 2583]. In the present study, {FEP/REMD} is extended and combined with an accelerated {MD} simulations method based on Hamiltonian replica-exchange {MD} {(H-REMD)} to overcome the additional problems arising from the existence of kinetically trapped conformations within the protein receptor. In the combined strategy, each system with a given thermodynamic coupling factor ? in the extended ensemble is further coupled with a set of replicas evolving on a biased energy surface with boosting potentials used to accelerate the interconversion among different rotameric states of the side chains in the neighborhood of the binding site. Exchanges are allowed to occur alternatively along the axes corresponding to the thermodynamic coupling parameter ? and the boosting potential, in an extended dual array of coupled ?- and {H-REMD} simulations. The method is implemented on the basis of new extensions to the {REPDSTR} module of the biomolecular simulation program {CHARMM.} As an illustrative example, the absolute binding free energy of p-xylene to the nonpolar cavity of the {L99A} mutant of the T4 lysozyme was calculated. The tests demonstrate that the dual {?-REMD} and {H-REMD} simulation scheme greatly accelerates the configurational sampling of the rotameric states of the side chains around the binding pocket, thereby improving the convergence of the {FEP} computations.},

Combined with the results of Woodard, Schmidler and Huber (2009), these results yield a two-sided bound on the spectral gap of these algorithms. We identify a persistence property of the target distribution, and show that it can lead unexpectedly to slow mixing that commonly used convergence diagnostics will fail to detect. For a multimodal distribution, the persistence is a measure of how ``spiky'', or tall and narrow, one peak is relative to the other peaks of the distribution. We show that this persistence phenomenon can be used to explain the torpid mixing of parallel and simulated tempering on the ferromagnetic mean-field Potts model shown previously. We also illustrate how it causes torpid mixing of tempering on a mixture of normal distributions with unequal covariances in {R{\textasciicircum}M,} a previously unknown result with relevance to statistical inference problems. More generally, anytime a multimodal distribution includes both very narrow and very wide peaks of comparable probability mass, parallel and simulated tempering are shown to mix slowly.},
